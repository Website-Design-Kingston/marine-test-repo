									<p>These drawings are the ship plans of <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> drafted just after the War of 1812 to record how was built. The ship was actually built so quickly during the war that the plans were drawn after the ship was launched and the war was over!</p>
									<p><em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> had three tiers of guns-decks carrying as many as 56 guns per side.</p>
									<p>Compared to ocean going warships that needed deeper hulls for provisions and greater stability, Great Lakes ships tended to be shallow-drafted. They were never long at sea, so they could be designed to maximize the number of guns they could carry (guns are what we think of as canons!).</p>

									<p>In 1833, the hulk of <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was towed out of Navy Bay by a side-wheel steamship, across town to the site of the Morton Brewery & Distillery.</p>
									<p>Story has it that nearing its destination, high winds ran the ship into the land just offshore of the brewery.</p>
									<p>Here, the mighty hulk would serve as a supply dock where steamships could pull alongside and load up with wood. <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> would never again move from this spot.</p>
									<p>Overtime, the ship was likely salvaged for wood, as it slowly decayed into the water, leaving only the remains we see today.</p><!-- END Section 3 Content -->

									<p>This is a painting from around 1815 (the artist is unknown), depicting the launch of <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em>. It was large as some of the ocean-going warships of the time.</p>
									<p>To this day, it is the largest sailing ship ever launched on the Great Lakes. It had three gun-decks, 58 metres in length, and could carry up to 112 guns, which we sometimes call canons.</p>
									<p>For the remainder of the war, no American ship dared confront this mighty ship, so just the fact that <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> even existed, gave the British complete control of Lake Ontario.</p>

									<p>After the war of 1812, British and American warships were no longer needed, or even allowed to sail the Great Lakes.</p>
									<p>For 17 years the hulk of the mighty <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was moored in the Royal Navy Dockyard. Its masts and rigging were removed along with all its guns, and the hull was covered to protect it from the elements.</p>
									<p>Finally, late in 1831, The Royal Navy decided it was time to get rid of all its unused warships. So the <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> and three other warships were put up for public auction, as shown in the newspaper clipping to the right.</p>
									<p>Early the following year, <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was sold to the Morton Brewery & Distillery for Â£25, which is less than $3,000 dollars in todayâs money. In 1833, the hulk of the <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was towed to its new home across town.</p><!-- END Section 7 Content -->

										<p>His Majestyâs Dock Yard, Kingston, U.C, 15th November, 1831.</p>
										<p>NOTICE is hereby given, that on the 18th day of January, 2832, at 10 oâclock, A.M. the Hulls of the following Ships as they now law on the shore off the Kingâs Dock Yard at Kingston, Upper Canada, will be disposed of by Public Auction, viz : St. Lawrence of 112 Guns. Kingston of 56 Guns. Burlington of 42 Guns. Montreal of 24 Guns. Also, the Frames of the Wolf and Canada, each pierced for 110 guns, as they stand on the Stocks in Dock Yard.</p>
										<p>Immediately after the above Sale, a quantity of standing and running Rigging, late belonging to the St. Lawrence, Kingston, Burlington and Montreal, will in like manner be disposed of. As this Rigging has been but little used, and is in good condition, it may be advantageously related or otherwise converted.</p>
										<p>The Ships will be disposed of separately, and the Rigging will be divided into lots to suit purchasers. A reasonable time will be allowed for the removal of the articles from the Kingâs premises, which must be done at the purchaserâs expense. A deposit of twenty-five per cent will be required at the time of sale, and the remainder of the purchase money previous to the removal of the articles.</p>
										<p>Further particulars may be learned at the Naval Store Keeperâs Office, at Kingston Dock Yard, and of Mr. William Lunn, clerk in charge of naval stores at Montreal. On the opening of the navigation in 1832, about Twelve Hundred Spurs for Masts and Yards, of from four to thirtyâfour inches in diameter, will be disposed of by Public Auction. Timely notice will be given of the days of sale. The spars may be previously examined; for which purpose application must be made at the Naval Store Keeperâs Office. J.R. GLOVER, Naval Store Keeper.</p><!-- END Section 7 Article Transcript -->

                        <p>These drawings are the ship plans drafted just after the War of 1812 to record how <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was built. The ship was actually built so quickly during the war that the plans were drawn after the ship was launched and the war was over!</p>
                        <p><em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> had three tiers of guns-decks carrying as many as 56 guns per side.</p>
                        <p>Compared to ocean going warships, Great Lakes ships tended to be shallow-drafted. They were never long at sea, so they could be designed to maximize the number of guns they could carry (guns are what we think of as canons!).</p>

                        <p>This is a painting from around 1815 (the artist is unknown), depicting the launch of <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em>. It was large as some of the ocean-going warships of the time.</p>
                        <p>To this day, it is the largest sailing ship ever launched on the Great Lakes. It had three gun-decks, 58 metres in length, and could carry up to 112 guns (which we sometimes call canons).</p>
                        <p>For the remainder of the war, no American ship dared confront this mighty ship, so just the fact that <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> even existed, gave the British complete control of Lake Ontario.</p>
                        <p>And so it was that the mightiest warship of the Great Lakes never engaged in actual combat!</p><!-- END Modal #6 Content Slide 1 -->

                        <p>After the war of 1812, British and American warships were no longer needed, or even allowed to sail the Great Lakes.</p>
                        <p>For 17 years the hulk of the mighty <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was moored in the Royal Navy Dockyard. Its masts and rigging were removed along with all its guns, and the hull was covered to protect it from the elements.</p>
                        <p>Finally, late in 1831, The Royal Navy decided it was time to get rid of all its unused warships. So the HMS St. Lawrence and three other warships were put up for public auction, as shown in the newspaper clipping to the right.</p>
                        <p>Early the following year, <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was sold to the Morton Brewery & Distillery for Â£25, which is less than $3,000 dollars in todayâs money. In 1833, the hulk of the <em>HMS St. Lawrence</em> was towed to its new home across town.</p><!-- END Modal #7 Content Slide 1 -->

                                            <p>His Majestyâs Dock Yard, Kingston, U.C, 15th November, 1831.</p>
                                            <p>NOTICE is hereby given, that on the 18th day of January, 2832, at 10 oâclock, A.M. the Hulls of the following Ships as they now law on the shore off the Kingâs Dock Yard at Kingston, Upper Canada, will be disposed of by Public Auction, viz : St. Lawrence of 112 Guns. Kingston of 56 Guns. Burlington of 42 Guns. Montreal of 24 Guns. Also, the Frames of the Wolf and Canada, each pierced for 110 guns, as they stand on the Stocks in Dock Yard.</p>
                                            <p>Immediately after the above Sale, a quantity of standing and running Rigging, late belonging to the St. Lawrence, Kingston, Burlington and Montreal, will in like manner be disposed of. As this Rigging has been but little used, and is in good condition, it may be advantageously related or otherwise converted.</p>
                                            <p>The Ships will be disposed of separately, and the Rigging will be divided into lots to suit purchasers. A reasonable time will be allowed for the removal of the articles from the Kingâs premises, which must be done at the purchaserâs expense. A deposit of twenty-five per cent will be required at the time of sale, and the remainder of the purchase money previous to the removal of the articles.</p>
                                            <p>Further particulars may be learned at the Naval Store Keeperâs Office, at Kingston Dock Yard, and of Mr. William Lunn, clerk in charge of naval stores at Montreal. On the opening of the navigation in 1832, about Twelve Hundred Spurs for Masts and Yards, of from four to thirtyâfour inches in diameter, will be disposed of by Public Auction. Timely notice will be given of the days of sale. The spars may be previously examined; for which purpose application must be made at the Naval Store Keeperâs Office. J.R. GLOVER, Naval Store Keeper.</p><!-- END Modal #7 Article Transcript -->
